# Chip Arena — current state

Migration prepared locally; not pushed and not released (2026-09-29).

- Proposed destination: `sheldon37/Chip-Arena`, private. Connector reports repository
  not found; ownership, visibility, hooks and permissions remain unverified.
- Source baseline: `18231698c7c79a7a604e567b933eb2d0155d7a3e`, clean `main`,
  68 existing commits; matches latest successfully published Site source (version 64).
  Work branch: `migration/shared-development`; full history retained.
- Runtime: TypeScript/Three.js/Rapier; Node authority; Electron shell
  `desktop/main.cjs`. Launcher 0.3.6; pinned Electron 44.4.5, Node 24.21.0,
  cloudflared 2026.9.3. Migration checks use Node 24.19.0/npm 11.9.0.
- Baseline game build `9b6caf05644a73c2cf5929da`; content `0.2.4cad5cbfa762`.
  Available Windows ZIP contains older content `0.2.44211e218269` with the same
  launcher. The owner's installed, possibly updated, copy is not accessible.
- Existing Site still serves updater downloads, identity, room discovery and relay.
  Its database and endpoints remain unchanged. No GitHub updater cutover.
- Settings use `chip-arena-preferences`; desktop uses persistent
  `arena://game` storage and an encrypted account-session file under userData.
- Baseline: typecheck passed; unit tests 406/419 passed (13 failed);
  identical after clean restore. WebSocket rematch/server build remain failing;
  HTTPS integration and Windows ZIP construction passed. Native Windows untested.

Next: make the intended private destination accessible, inspect remote history and
hooks, import the audited original baseline if empty, then push this branch/PR.
Resolve recorded baseline failures before enforcing a green merge/release gate.
Windows validation and desktop distribution cutover remain separate work.
